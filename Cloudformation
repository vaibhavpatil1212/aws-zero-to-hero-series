# What is AWS CloudFormation?

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources. 
You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon S3 buckets), 
and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.

This allows you to:
- Manage infrastructure as code
- Automate deployments
- Ensure consistency across environments
- Easily replicate environments for development, testing, and production

CloudFormation supports YAML and JSON formats for templates and integrates with other AWS services to provide a powerful infrastructure automation solution.
